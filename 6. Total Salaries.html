    <!-- You are tasked with implementing a function named calculateTotalSalaries that will navigate through a company’s
    hierarchical structure to calculate the cumulative sum of salaries for all employees. The company’s structure is
    depicted as a nested object, where each node can either be a department containing further sub-departments or an
    array of employees. Each employee is represented by an object containing their name and salary.

    The main challenge lies in efficiently traversing this nested structure, which may vary in depth and complexity
    across different companies, to aggregate all the salary values. This problem not only tests your ability to work
    with nested data structures but also assesses your recursive thinking and problem-solving skills.

    Input: A nested object representing the company’s structure, where each department can contain sub-departments or an
    array of employees with their respective salaries.

    Output: A single integer value representing the total sum of salaries of all employees across the entire company. -->


    <script>
        function calculateTotalSalaries(department) {
            // Base case: if department is an array, it's a list of employees
            if (Array.isArray(department)) {
                return department.reduce((sum, employee) => sum + employee.salary, 0);
            }

            // Recursive case: If it’s an object, we loop through its sub-departments and call the same function on each one.
            // department is an object with sub-departments
            let total = 0;
            for (let subDept of Object.values(department)) {
                total += calculateTotalSalaries(subDept);
            }
            return total;
        }



        const company = {
            sales: [
                { name: "John", salary: 1000 },
                { name: "Alice", salary: 1200 }
            ],
            development: {
                frontend: [
                    { name: "Bob", salary: 1500 },
                    { name: "Charlie", salary: 1600 }
                ],
                backend: [
                    { name: "Dave", salary: 1700 }
                ]
            }
        };

        console.log(calculateTotalSalaries(company));
        // Output: 7000
